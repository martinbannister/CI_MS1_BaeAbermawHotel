## User Experience
---
I have designed this site with a mobile first approach so the site is clear, easily navigable and the content collapses well and still looks good on smaller screens.

The user experienced is based around the main business goal of converting more website visitors by making it easy to book from any page.  This is why I chose not to hide the navigation in a collapsible menu on smaller devices.  All pages retain the header navigation, albeit styled differently, with the "Book Now" button featuring prominently on all devices.

### Target Audience
- Holiday Makers
- Pet Owners
- Families
- Business People
- Casual Diners
### User Stories
I have chosen to break down my user stories into three separate sections based on how a user will interact with the website.  **First time visitors** will invariably want more information than **returning visitors** who are more likely to know exactly where to go or in the case of Bae Abermaw Hotel book a room.  Finally we have the **hotel owner's** perspective of how they want the site to be used.
#### First Time Visitors
1. As a first time visitor I want know what the hotel offer and whether it can cater for my family and dog.
2. As a first time visitor I want to be able to access the hotel's social media accounts so I can see what real people think of the place.
3. As a first time visitor I want to be able to see the rooms to establish if they're suitable for my needs.
4. As a first time visitor I want to find the location of the hotel so I can check if it's close to other attractions in the area.
5. As a first time visitor I want to be able to book a room easily if I like that I see.
#### Returning Visitors
6. As a returning visitor I want to book a room quickly and easily.
7. As a returning visitor I would like to read more information about the area that I might have overlooked on my first visit.
8. As a returning visitor I want to spend time looking at photo's of the room I've got booked so I can look forward to my holiday.
#### Hotel Owner
9. As the hotel owner I want customers to be able to book a room with the minimum amount of friction.
10. As the hotel owner I want to convey the quality of the hotel and rooms through the website.
11. As the hotel owner I want the website to reflect the style and brand of the hotel.
