## User Experience
---
I have designed this site with a mobile first approach so the site is clear, easily navigable and the content collapses well and still looks good on smaller screens.

The user experienced is based around the main business goal of converting more website visitors by making it easy to book from any page.  This is why I chose not to hide the navigation in a collapsible menu on smaller devices.  All pages retain the header navigation, albeit styled differently, with the "Book Now" button featuring prominently on all devices.

### Target Audience
- Holiday Makers
- Pet Owners
- Families
- Business People
- Casual Diners
### User Stories
I have chosen to break down my user stories into three separate sections based on how a user will interact with the website.  **First time visitors** will invariably want more information than **returning visitors** who are more likely to know exactly where to go or in the case of Bae Abermaw Hotel book a room.  Finally we have the **hotel owner's** perspective of how they want the site to be used.
#### First Time Visitors
1. As a first time visitor I want know what the hotel offer and whether it can cater for my family and dog.
2. As a first time visitor I want to be able to access the hotel's social media accounts so I can see what real people think of the place.
3. As a first time visitor I want to be able to see the rooms to establish if they're suitable for my needs.
4. As a first time visitor I want to find the location of the hotel so I can check if it's close to other attractions in the area.
5. As a first time visitor I want to be able to book a room easily if I like that I see.

#### Returning Visitors
6. As a returning visitor I want to book a room quickly and easily.
7. As a returning visitor I would like to read more information about the area that I might have overlooked on my first visit.
8. As a returning visitor I want to spend time looking at photo's of the room I've got booked so I can look forward to my holiday.

#### Hotel Owner
9. As the hotel owner I want customers to be able to book a room with the minimum amount of friction.
10. As the hotel owner I want to convey the quality of the hotel and rooms through the website.
11. As the hotel owner I want the website to reflect the style and brand of the hotel.

## Scope
Based on the goals, business and user requirements for this inital release I have opted for a simple tree structure with only 1 level of depth.  This means no information is hidden or burried, the user can't get lost and there is a strong call to action on every page.<br>
Based on that I have defined the following features:
- A Navigation header is present on all pages and does not collapse completely on mobile failitating rapid navigation.
- A fixed footer at the bottom of every page offers navigation when the header navigation is out of view and provides social media links.
- A *book now* button provides a modal form to book a room from whichever page.
- The home page includes key information about the facilities available.

## Technologies Used

### Languages

- [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) (From W3C How To)

### Frameworks, libraries and other tools

## Testing

### HTML Validation
I used the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate the HTML of all the pages on the site. Initially the pages showed some errors and these were corrected.

Links to the inial report and the final result with no errors are in the table below.

Initial | Final
-|-
[index.html](docs/validation/html/index_html_validation_initial.pdf) | [index.html](docs/validation/html/index_html_validation_final.pdf) 
[rooms.html](docs/validation/html/rooms_html_validation_initial.pdf) | [rooms.html](docs/validation/html/rooms_html_validation_final.pdf)
[about.html](docs/validation/html/about_html_validation_initial.pdf) | [about.html](docs/validation/html/about_html_validation_final.pdf)

[404.html](docs/validation/html/404_html_validation_initial.pdf) | Passed 1st time

### CSS Validation
I used the [W3C CSS Validation Service](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) to validate my style.css file of the site.

The CSS passed first time with [zero errors](docs/validation/css/W3C_CSS_Validation.png).

### Accessibility
I used the [WAVE WebAIM web accessibility evaluation tool](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://martinbannister.github.io/CI_MS1_BaeAbermawHotel/) to check that there we no issues with accessibility standards.  

All pages pass without errors except for about.html.

There is a contrast error on about.html due to the colour of the # of # ( x / y ) text in the corner of the image slideshow.  This is due to the colour of the text matching the background of the page.  However I chose this colour for consistency of design and because it provides the best contrast with the area of the images it overlays.  The contrast error caused by using the same colour as the background is on the basis that the text should still be visible should the image fail to load, however in this case without the loaded image the '#image of #images' is irrelevant anyway. So I decided that this error need not be resolved.

### Performance

[Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) produced a rating of 100 on Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO on all pages.  All pages except rooms.html rated between 97 and 99.  

rooms.html only rated 72 due to the size of the images that the page serves, some of which are hidden on initial page load.  The image sizes should be reduced however given the time constraints on this project I have decided to leave this for a future release since the inital user experience isn't significantly reduced.

### Tests on Various Devices

#### Devices Tested
- Honor 10 (Chrome & Firefox)
- Honor Play
- Lenovo Thinkpad C13 Yoga (Chrome & Firefox)
- iPhone XS Max

#### Tests Performed

1. All links, including page naviagation and modal popup triggers arrive at the correct page and no links are broken.
2. External links open in a new tab on all devices and do not navigate away from the main site.
3. Content collapses neatly and continues to look tidy and be clearly visible on all devices.
4. Modals popup correctly, can be scrolled where necessary and dismissed easily.
5. The Book Now modal popup displays correctly on all pages, will not submit unless all required fields are completed and warns the user on error.
6. The contact us form displays correctly on all devices and will not submit unless all required fields are complete.
7. The map on the contact us page still functions at all screen sizes and correctly shows the location of the hotel.

#### Results

3. After removing the button around the *a* tag for the Book Now link following HTML validation the Book Now link spans the width of it's containing column at certain breakpoints, which on the **Kindle Fire HDX Lunix** (as identified in Firefox's inspector tool) specifically, does not look good.

---

5. The Book Now modal on Firefox for Android does not provide any validation warning when pressing the Book button and required fields have not been completed.  This is regardless of the field type left incomplete.  

Although an old thread the comment by user Simone on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43868163/required-attribute-does-not-work-on-firefox) suggests this could be because something is overridden by a stylesheet.  This will require further investigation.

---

6. The contact form suffers from the same problem on Firefox for Android as the Book Now modal.
