## User Experience
---
I have designed this site with a mobile first approach so the site is clear, easily navigable and the content collapses well and still looks good on smaller screens.

The user experienced is based around the main business goal of converting more website visitors by making it easy to book from any page.  This is why I chose not to hide the navigation in a collapsible menu on smaller devices.  All pages retain the header navigation, albeit styled differently, with the "Book Now" button featuring prominently on all devices.
